# NYC Hotel Map

## Project Description

The **NYC Hotel Map** is an interactive web application designed to display the locations of popular hotels across New York City. The map allows users to explore hotels within each of the five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island—highlighted with distinct colors representing the percentage of hotel rooms in each borough. The hotels are marked with color-coded circles based on their price range: budget (yellow), mid-range (orange), and luxury (red). 

### Major Features:
- **Interactive Map**: Displays the hotel locations in New York City using Leaflet.js.
- **Price Filtering**: Hotels are color-coded based on price ranges ($, $$, $$$).
- **Boroughs Highlighting**: Different colors represent the percentage of hotel rooms in each NYC borough.
- **Legend and Information**: A legend is included to provide color references and hotel price ranges.
  
### Libraries Used:
- **Leaflet.js**: A leading JavaScript library for interactive maps.
